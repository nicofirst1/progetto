#Movienator
This project is about machine learning, in particular **sentiment analysis**, for a list of movie reviews.
##Getting Started
This project is about the Kaggle challenge called [Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial).
###Prerequisite
You'll need to have python 3+ installed
###Installing
To get the project going you need to run `python setup.py install` on your command line. Make sure to be in this directory before running the setup.py.
###Running
To run the classification you'll have to go into *Runner.py* in *src* directory and run either one or both functions. 

You need to know that executing one of these functions will take approximately half an hour, on my MacBook Pro [2,9 GHz Intel Core i5].

##More info
If you're interested and want to learn more about this project, there are some papers into the directory *Papers* in which
I explain how and why I created all this. Unfortunately, these papers are in Italian, my mother language, but by looking at
Kaggel's link and my code comments you can easily figure out what I did. Furthermore, there are some diagrams in *diagrams* 
directory which are very straight forward to understand.
